# E12a-Animation

Exercise 12a for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington. In this exercise I practive creating animations in Blender to then use in Godot. First I followed this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBYb1YmaOMY to create an animated Blender model. Then, I used GDscript to enable and control the animation just created in Blender.
